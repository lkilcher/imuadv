The profiler measurements---taken at the same depth as the ADV on the TTM---were contaminated by acoustic reflection from the strongback fin when it was inline with one of the profiler's beams.

\subsection{Mean velocity}

Figure \ref{fig:vel_time} shows a comparison of $\vec{\bar u}$ measured by an ADV-IMU mounted on a TTM, to an upward-looking acoustic Doppler profiler mounted on the TTM anchor. This comparison shows excellent agreement between the ADV and Doppler profiler measurements of mean velocity. The $\bar u$, $\bar v$, and $\bar w$ components have a root-mean-square error of 0.05, 0.13, and 0.03 m/s, respectively. Although it is important to note that there is some discrepancy between ADP- and ADV-measured velocities (especially in $\bar v$, which is most likely due to incomplete motion correction), the agreement between the magnitude and direction of these independent velocity measurements indicates that moored ADV-IMUs provide a reliable estimate of mean velocity in the Earth's reference frame.

\subsection{TTM spectra}

The rows are for each component of velocity (indicated to the lower right of the right column). The uncorrected spectra are in black and the corrected spectra are blue, and the spectra of ADV head motion, $\uhead$, is red (also indicated in the legend). The vertical red dotted line indicates the filter frequency applied to the IMU accelerometers when estimating $\uhead$; below this frequency $\spec{\uhead}$ is plotted as a dashed line.   Diagonal black dotted lines indicate a $f^{-5/3}$ slope. The cyan line in the first and last rows indicates the semi-empirical Kaimal spectrum for the measured values of $\ustar$ and $U$.

  \label{fig:spec:ttm}
\end{figure*}

As discussed in detail in Part 1, the mooring motion of the TTM, $\spec{\uhead}$, has a peak at 0.1 to 0.2 Hz from swaying of the mooring that is most likely driven by eddy shedding from the spherical buoy (Figure \ref{fig:spec:ttm}, red lines). There is also higher-frequency broadband motion that is associated with fluttering of the strongback fin around the mooring line. Both of these motions are especially energetic in the $v$-component spectra because this is the direction in which the TTM mooring system is most unstable. As is expected from fluid-structure interaction theory, the amplitude of these motions increases with increasing mean velocity \cite[]{Morison++1950}.

The mooring motion contaminates the uncorrected ADV measurements of velocity, $\spec{\umeas}$, whenever the amplitude of the motion is similar to or greater than the amplitude of the turbulence. Fortunately, much of this motion can be removed using the IMU's motion signals as detailed in Section \ref{sec:methods}. Lacking an independent measurement of turbulence velocity at this site, we interpret the agreement of these spectra with turbulence theory as evidence that motion correction has improved the velocity measurements. In particular, at high frequencies ($f>0.3$ Hz) for each mean-flow speed, the spectra decay with a $f^{-5/3}$ slope and have equal amplitude across the velocity components. These results are consistent with \citeauthor{Kolmogorov1941c}'s (1941) theory of isotropic turbulence, and are consistent with the semi-empirical spectral form of \cite{Kaimal++1972}, and other earlier measurements of turbulence in energetic tidal channels from stationary platforms \cite[]{Walter++2011, Thomson++2012, McMillan++2016}.

The degree of agreement between Kaimal's theoretical form and these measurements is similar to that of \cite{Walter++2011}. This is an encouraging result, especially considering that $\ustar$ is estimated at the height of the measurement (10 m) rather than at the seafloor. This suggests that bottom-boundary layer physics are contributing to the turbulence at this site and depth.

For $|\ue|>1.0$, motion correction modifies the $u$ and $v$ component spectra at frequencies as high as 3 Hz. This outcome indicates that in order for motion correction to be effective, synchronization between the ADV and IMU needs to be within 1/3 s or better. This suggests that asynchronous approaches to motion correction may be challenging, especially considering that the clock drift of some instrumentation can be as high as a few seconds per day. By integrating the IMU data into the ADV data stream, the Nortek ADV-IMU achieves a synchronization to within 1e-2 s. 

The low magnitude of $\spec{\uhead}$ at low frequencies is partially a result of filtering the IMU's accelerometer signal when calculating $\uacc$. The true low-frequency spectrum of ADV head motion is unknown (indicated using a dashed line below $f_a$). A comparison of $\spec{\ue}$ measured by the TTM to that measured by the ADP---during the June 2012 deployment---reveals agreement at low frequencies (not shown). This finding suggests that the assumption that $\ulow=0$ at these frequencies and at this site for this platform is justified---even if $\spec{\uhead}$ is not as low as indicated in Figure \ref{fig:spec:ttm}.

As successful as motion correction is, some of the motion contamination persists in $\spec{\ue}$. This is most notable in $\spec{v}$ at the highest flow speeds ($>2.0$ m/s): a peak at 0.15 Hz is an order of magnitude larger than a spectral fit to the other frequencies would indicate. This persistent motion contamination is evident to a lesser degree in $\spec{u}$ for $|u|>2$ m/s, and in $\spec{v}$ at lower flow speeds.  $\spec{w}$ appears to have no persistent motion contamination because the amplitude of the motion in this direction is much lower than for the other two components. For these measurements, $\spec{w_h}$ is so low that $w$-component motion correction makes only a minor correction to the spectra.

The amplitude of the persistent motion contamination peaks in $\spec{v}$ at 0.15 Hz is a factor of 5 to 10 times smaller than the amplitude of the ADV head motion itself. This observation suggests that the Microstrain IMU can be used to effectively correct mooring motion at 0.15 Hz when the amplitude of that motion is less than 5 times the amplitude of the real turbulence spectrum. As a result, we have chosen a value of 3 as a conservative estimate of the motion correction's effectiveness.

% Does this belong in the discussion?
In addition to the primary benefit of correcting for mooring motion, the IMU measurements can also be used to identify and screen out persistent motion contamination. For example, one of the most common uses of turbulence spectra is for the calculation of $\epsilon$ and $\tke$. For these purposes, and based on the relative amplitudes of the 0.15-Hz peaks, we assume that persistent motion contamination is likely, where $\spec{\uhead}/\spec{\ue} > 3$, and thereby exclude these regions from spectral fits.

In the present case, for the $u$ and $w$ spectra, this criteria only excludes a narrow range of frequencies at the 0.15-Hz motion peak for some cases. This criteria is more restrictive of the $v$-component spectra at high frequencies for $\bar U > 1.0$ m/s, but this may be acceptable because the amplitude of $\spec{v}$ at these frequencies---i.e., in the isotropic inertial subrange---should be equal to that of $\spec{u}$ and $\spec{w}$ \cite[]{Kolmogorov1941c}.

Agreement of the $v$-component spectral amplitude with that of $u$ and $w$ at frequencies $>0.3$ Hz indicates that motion correction is effective at those frequencies even when $\spec{\uhead}/\spec{\ue} \gtrsim 3$. This outcome suggests that our screening threshold is excessively conservative at those frequencies, and that a more precise screening threshold may be frequency dependent. For example, it might take into account the $~f^3$ character of the noise in $\spec{\uacc}$ (Figure \ref{fig:stnoise}). For the purpose of this work, the $\spec{\uhead}/\spec{\ue} < 3$ threshold for spectral fits is sufficient, and detailed characterization of the IMU's motion- and frequency-dependent noise level is left for future work.

\subsection{StableMoor Spectra}

\begin{figure*}[th]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{SpecFig02_SMnose}
  \caption{Turbulence spectra from the SMB. The axes layout and annotations are identical to Figure \ref{fig:spec:ttm}, except that $\spec{\uhead}$ is plotted as a solid line at all frequencies because it is measured at all frequencies. }
  \label{fig:spec:sm}
\end{figure*}

Spectra of SMB motion have broader peaks, with a maximum amplitude that is approximately half the frequency of the TTM spectral peak (0.06 Hz, Figure \ref{fig:spec:sm}). The motion of this platform also does not have high-frequency ``subpeaks" or other high-frequency broadbanded excitation (Part 1).  These characteristics of the motion are most likely due to the more massive and hydrodynamically streamlined properties of the SMB compared to the TTM. 

Like the TTM, the motion-corrected spectra from the SMB are consistent with turbulence theory and previous observations. Most importantly, there is an improvement in the quality of the motion-corrected spectra compared to the TTM. In particular, the persistent motion contamination peaks are completely removed. That is, this measurement system provides an accurate estimate of the turbulence spectra at this location from low frequencies to more than 1 Hz---well into the inertial subrange---for all three components of velocity.

Note that this level of accuracy cannot be obtained without the independent estimate of $\ulow$. If we assume that $\ulow=0$, a similar plot to Figure \ref{fig:spec:sm} (not shown) reveals persistent motion-contamination peaks and troughs in the $u$ and $v$ spectra regardless of the choice of $f_a$. This assumption indicates that the low-frequency motion of the SMB is below a threshold in which the IMU's signal-to-noise ratio is high enough to resolve its motion. In other words, compared to the TTM, the SMB provides a more accurate measurement of turbulence when it includes an independent measure of $\ulow$ (here a bottom-tracking ADP), but it does no better---and perhaps worse---when it does not.

\subsection{Torpedo spectra}

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{SpecFig03_TTT}
  \caption{Turbulence spectra from the turbulence torpedo during a 35-minute period when the mean velocity was 1.3 m/s. Annotations and line colors are identical to Figure \ref{fig:spec:ttm}.}
  \label{fig:spec:torpedo}
\end{figure}

The $u$ and $v$ motion of the turbulence torpedo is broadband and the $w$ motion has a narrow peak at 0.3 Hz (Figure \ref{fig:spec:torpedo}). Because $\uhead$ is estimated using $f_a = 0.03$ Hz and assuming $\ulow=0$, its spectra rolls off quickly below $f_a$.  Motion correction of the torpedo data appears to effectively remove a motion peak from $\spec{w}$ at 0.3 Hz, and straightens out $\spec{v}$ between 0.04 and 0.6 Hz. $\spec{u}$ is mostly unaffected by motion at these frequencies, because the torpedo motion is smaller than the turbulence in this direction. At frequencies below $f_a$, $\spec{u}$ and $\spec{v}$ increase dramatically. This increase suggests that unresolved, low-frequency motion of the torpedo is contaminating the velocity measurements at these frequencies. It may be possible to correct for some of this contamination using a measurement of the ship's motion as a proxy for the torpedo's low-frequency motion, but this has not been done. Still, above $f_a$, the torpedo appears to provide a reliable estimate of spectral amplitude in the inertial subrange and can therefore be used to estimate $\epsilon$. Considering the simplicity of the platform, it may be a useful option for quantifying this turbulence statistic in a variety of scenarios. Further, if a GPS is positioned above it, it may be capable of providing even more.


\subsection{Cross Spectra}

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{StressSpec_TTM_04vp}
  \caption{Variance preserving cross-spectra between components of $\ue$ (blue), $\uhead$ (red), and $\umeas$ (black) from the June 2014 TTM deployment. The upper row is $f \cdot \cspec{u}{v}$, the middle row is $f \cdot \cspec{u}{w}$, and the bottom row is $f \cdot \cspec{v}{w}$ (also indicated at right).  Note that these cross-spectra are between components of a velocity vector (e.g., $\ue$), not between different vectors (i.e., not between $\ue$ and $\umeas$). N is the number of spectral ensembles in this average, i.e. when $2 < |u| < 2.5\,\mathrm{[ms^{-1}]}$. The light blue shading indicates one standard deviation of $f \cdot C\{\ue\}$.}
  \label{fig:cspec:ttm}
\end{figure}

Cross-spectra indicate the correlation between different velocity components as a function of frequency, and their integrals are the Reynold's stresses. Head motion cross-spectra, $C\{\uhead\}$ (Figure \ref{fig:cspec:ttm}, red), and uncorrected velocity cross-spectra, $C\{\umeas\}$ (black), from TTM measurements have large peaks at the same frequency (~0.15 Hz) as peaks in auto-spectra (Figure \ref{fig:spec:ttm}).  This indicates that mooring motion contaminates the uncorrected cross-spectral velocity measurements, and that Reynold's stress estimates based on uncorrected velocity measurements will be contaminated by mooring motion. 

Fortunately, motion corrected velocity cross-spectra, $C\{\ue\}$ (blue), have dramatically reduced spectral amplitudes at these frequencies (reduced peaks). This indicates that motion correction reduces motion contamination to produce more reliable estimates of velocity cross spectra and Reynold's stresses (Figure \ref{fig:cspec:ttm}). In particular, the uncertainty in $f\cdot C\{\ue\}$ (indicated by the blue shading), is significantly smaller than the mean values of $C\{\uhead\}$ and $C\{\umeas\}$ at the frequencies of maximum motion (0.15 Hz). This indicates that even the individual values of $C\{\ue\}$ are reduced at these frequencies, compared to $C\{\umeas\}$, not just their mean.

These results indicate that motion-corrected TTM velocity measurements can be used to estimate turbulence Reynold's stresses. Without motion correction, Reynold's stress estimates would be contaminated by the large peaks in the cross spectra that are caused by the swaying and fluttering motion of the TTM vane. Cross-spectra of TTM data for other velocity ranges (i.e., < 2 ms$^{-1}$), and cross-spectra from the SMB show similar results (not shown). However, we note that because the SMB is less-stable in pitch than the TTM (see Part I for details), the TTM provides a more accurate estimates of  $\uw$.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{CoSpecND03_TTM-both}
  \caption{Non-dimensional cross-spectra of motion-corrected velocity, $\hat{C}\{u,w\}$, on a log-log scale. The average over $\Delta \hat{f} = 0.04$ bins is shown in blue, and single points are grey (negative values not shown). The semi-empirical \cite{Kaimal++1972} form is shown as a thick black line, and the red dashed line indicates a $\hat{f}^{-7/3}$ slope. Cross-spectral estimates from measurements from a fixed `tripod' are in purple.}
  \label{fig:cspecnd:ttm}
\end{figure}

In order to compare the cross-spectra to other measurements, we normalize them following \cite[]{Kaimal++1972} as: $\hat{C}\{u,w\}(\hat{f}) = -\cspec{u}{w} \cdot f_\circ / \ustar^2$, where $f_\circ = U / z$ and $\hat{f} = f / f_\circ$. 
When plotted on a log-log scale, the non-dimensional cross-spectra between $u$ and $w$ has a $\hat{f}^{-7/3}$ high-frequency spectral slope that is consistent with other measurements (Figure \ref{fig:cspecnd:ttm}). At low-frequency, the cross-spectra are more than 10x smaller than the semi-empirical Kaimal form, but this discrepancy is consistent with other measurements of cross-spectra. In particular, \cite{Walter++2011} observed a half-decade reduction from the Kaimal form near the seafloor, and measurements from an ADV positioned 4.6 m above the seafloor on a fixed tripod at a different site in Puget Sound show a similar degree of deviation as observed here \cite[]{Thomson++2012}. %Furthermore, the low-$\hat{f}$ mean is pulled-down by the negative values of $\hat{C}\{u,w\}$. 

While one might be inclined to attribute the discrepancy between these estimates and the Kaimal form to normalization by local $\ustar$, the agreement between auto-spectra and their Kaimal form suggests otherwise (Figure \ref{fig:spec:ttm}). Instead, we conclude that either the Kaimal-form for cross-spectra does not apply universally at distances far from the bottom boundary, and/or the spectra are being modified by physics other than bottom boundary layer driven turbulence. Either way, the agreement of TTM-measured cross-spectra with measurements from stationary platforms is interpreted as an encouraging sign that this platform can resolve Reynold's stresses.
