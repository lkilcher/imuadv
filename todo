- Clear unnecessary files from releases (v1.1?)

- citations for software (in acknowledgements?)

- Add a DOI or 'extra material' that points to this repo

X Move SM bottom track incorporation into SM2015 data folder!!!
  - Now planning to simply roll existing script into this repo
    directly. Will include this functionality in next later version of
    SM2015 data if necessary

- Fix vector styling (bold instead of \vec)

fig/TimeFig01
? Change y-axis sizes so that 1m/s is the same vertical size on all plots
