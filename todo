fig/TimeFig01
? Compare to 'old-style' ADV measurements?
? Change y-axis sizes so that 1m/s is the same vertical size on all plots
? Plot mag/direction instead? Difference?

fig/SpecFig_annot
- Consistent mplstyle

- Consistent legends

- Do we need the bench tests from Nortek?

DATA ORGANIZATION
- Add DOLfYN support for CSV output.


DISCUSSION
- We tried a spectral approach to MC, but it diddn't work because you need the phase information.
- Discuss SNR of \uhead compared to measurements.
- These results are specific to this site and platform. In particular, the TKE+dissipation level, relative to the amplitude of motion, will determine the success of the approach.
