DISCUSSION
- We tried a spectral approach to MC, but it diddn't work because you need the phase information.
- Discuss SNR of \uhead compared to measurements.
- These results are specific to this site and platform. In particular, the TKE+dissipation level, relative to the amplitude of motion, will determine the success of the approach.
