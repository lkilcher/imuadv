- Use 'SMB' for StableMoor buoy, add '^TM'

- Ref Maricarmen's paper!

- Add ref to appendix of Harding++2017 on how to sync BT and IMU measurements.

- Remove \newcommand definitions in parent file

- citations for software (in acknowledgements?)

- Move SM bottom track incorporation into SM2015 data folder!!!

- Improve methods section to discuss bias-drift?

- Space-out panels (so y-labels don't overlap, eg Fig 8)

py/make_map.py
- Make map of larger area?
- Change font sizes?
- Indicate direction of principal axes.
- Add tidal-flow arrow.

fig/TTM_Image01
- Add l* vec?

fig/SM_NoseMode01
- Add l* vec

fig/ttm04b
- Increase font sizes?
- Add pop-up buoy?

py/motion_coherence.py:
- Confirm how to calculate uncertainty of angles (for phase-shift
  plot, if we're going to use it).

fig/TimeFig01
? Compare to 'old-style' ADV measurements?
? Change y-axis sizes so that 1m/s is the same vertical size on all plots
? Plot mag/direction instead? Difference?

fig/SpecFig_annot
- Consistent mplstyle
- Multiple velocity ranges?
- Consistent legends

- Do we need the bench tests from Nortek?

DATA ORGANIZATION
- Add DOLfYN support for CSV output.


DISCUSSION
- We tried a spectral approach to MC, but it diddn't work because you need the phase information.
- Discuss SNR of \uhead compared to measurements.
- These results are specific to this site and platform. In particular, the TKE+dissipation level, relative to the amplitude of motion, will determine the success of the approach.
