This work presents a methodology for measuring turbulence from moored IMU-ADVs, and details an approach for removing the IMU-measured mooring motion from the ADV's velocity measurements. The IMU integrated into the Nortek Vector ADV has been configured to provide estimates of the ADVs orientation and motion at every time-step of the ADV's sampling. The tight integration of the IMU and ADV data streams provides a data set that can be used to correct velocity measurements for mooring motion and rotate those measurements into the earth's reference frame. 

Comparison of spectra of ADV head motion, $\spec{\uhead}$, to that of motion-corrected, $\spec{\ue}$, and uncorrected spectra, $\spec{\umeas}$, reveals that motion correction improves spectral estimates of moored ADV measurements. In particular, we find motion corrected spectra have spectral shapes that are similar to previous measurements of tidal-channel turbulence and have a $f^{-5/3}$ spectral slope at high frequencies. This suggests that the motion-corrected spectra resolve the inertial subrange predicted by Kolmogorov's theory of locally isotropic turbulence.

Motion correction reduces motion contamination for all platforms we presented, but it does not necessarily remove it completely. This seems to depend on the relative amplitude of platform motion compared to the underlying turbulence being measured. The most notable example of this is from the TTM, which has a large `swaying' peak at 0.1 Hz. Where this peak is very large---especially in the $v$-component---it is not reduced to a level that is consistent with earlier measurements of tidal-channel turbulence---i.e. there is no `smooth roll-off' between low-frequency energy-containing scales and the $f^{-5/3}$ inertial subrange.

This inconsistency indicates that turbulence measurements from moored, motion-corrected IMU-ADVs must be interpreted with care. An inspection of spectra presented here suggests that excluding spectral regions where $\spec{\uhead} / \spec{\ue} > 3$ removes `persistent motion contamination' peaks, while still preserving spectral regions where motion correction is effective. Using this criteria it is then possible to produce spectral fits that exclude persistent motion contamination, and provide reliable estimates of turbulence quantities of interest (e.g. $\epsilon$ and $\tke$).

We also find that motion correction reduces motion contamination in cross-spectra. This is important because it suggests that moored IMU-ADV measurements may be used to produce reliable estimates of Reynolds stresses. We utilized these stress estimates and vertical shear estimates, both from the TTM, to estimate $\produz$. 

Finally, we've shown that $\epsilon$ estimates based on motion-corrected spectra scale with the $U^3$, and balance $P_{uz}$ estimates during ebb and flood. Together, these results indicate that bottom boundary layer physics are a dominant process at this site, and that the boundary layer reaches the height of the IMU-ADVs (~10 m) during ebb and flood. The degree of agreement between $\produz$ and $\epsilon$ also serves as an indicator of the self-consistency of moored IMU-ADV turbulence measurements.
