\section{Introduction}

% Invented more than twenty years ago, acoustic Doppler velocimeters (ADVs) measure 3-components of velocity by measuring the Doppler shift of an emitted acoustic pulse at 3 

Since their invention more than twenty years ago acoustic Doppler velocimeters (ADVs) have been used to measure turbulent velocities in a wide range of environments. Originally designed to make point-measurements in laboratory flumes and tanks, ADVs have become an increasingly useful tool in the oceanic environment. They have been deployed, for example, on the seafloor to measure fluxes in the oceanic bottom boundary layer, in the surf-zone to measure Reynold's stresses, and from ships on downward protruding masts to measure surface mixing \citep[e.g.]{Lohrmann++1994, Voulgaris+Trowbridge1998, Kim++2000, Trowbridge+Elgar2003, Elgar++2005, Geyer++2008}.

Why is the turbulence spectrum important? -- Captures motion at all scales.
ADCPs 
1) History of ADV use. How are they used? In what turbulence levels? What is their noise-floor? 
1a) How do they compare to other turbulence tools?
Compared to profilers, ADVs are:
  - Lower precision than profilers at high f?
  - Capture low-frequency information.
  - can be fixed in space.
Compared to ADCP, ADVs can capture the turbulence spectrum:

  - Higher precision at high f
  - Higher resolution (down to cm scales)
  - Lower noise

Say something about: we don't have independent measurements of turbulence to validate against, so we use spectra--and our knowledge of their theoretical properties--to gain confidence in the method.

A primary limitation of ADVs is that it has been challenging to place them at mid-depths (i.e. away from the seafloor and the surface). In the oceanic environment they have either been deployed on fixed platforms anchored to the sea-floor, or deployed near the surface from a ship.  Until now, there has been no method for deploying these instruments at mid-water depths, or near the surface without a ship.  This work describes a new approach for measuring turbulence spectra from ADVs mounted on moorings. Until recently this approach has been limited by the fact that mooring motion contaminates the velocity measurements.  The frequency and amplitude of this contamination will depend on the characteristics of the mooring and of the turbulent environment in which it is deployed. In most cases mooring motion will--over some range of frequencies--be similar to or greater than the turbulence velocities one would like to measure. This `motion contamination' reduces usefulness of the ADV measurements.

  ADV velocity measurements from compliant moorings will be contaminated by mooring motion. When an inertial motion unit (IMU, also known as a magnetic, angular rate, gravity or MARG sensor) is rigidly attached to, and tightly synchronized with, acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) measurements the IMU's orientation and motion measurements can be used to reduce motion contamination.  Microstrain IMU on-board the Nortek Vector is equipped with a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis rotation-rate sensor, and a 3-axis magnetometer.  The Microstrain samples these signals at 1000Hz and performs integration and Kalman filtering operations to produce stable estimates of it's orientation, change in velocity, and change in rotation-rate.  and  can be configured to output estimates of,

\section{Measurements}
\label{sec:meas}

This work is focused on measuring turbulence spectra from moored ADVs that are equipped with inertial motion sensors (IMU). The ADVs utilized for these measurements were all equipped with Microstrain 3DM-GX3-25 IMU sensors that captured all 6 components of the ADV motion (3 components of angular rotation and 3 components of linear acceleration), as well the orientation of the ADV pressure-case. The sampling of the motion sensor is tightly synchronized with the ADV measurements. The IMU measures its motion at 1kHz and uses internal signal integration (Kalman filtering) to output the motion signals at the same sample rate as the ADV's velocity measurements. This reduces aliasing of the IMU's motion measurements above the ADV's sample-rate \cite{3DM-GX3_coning_sculling}.

This work utilizes data from two distinct mooring systems to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of each platform. Both mooring systems were deployed in Admiralty Inlet, Washington, approximately 500 meters (m) WSW of Admiralty Head--Fort Casey State Park--in 60 m of water at latitude 48.153 north and longitude 122.687 west (Figure \ref{fig:map}). Admiralty inlet possesses a large semi-diurnal tidal energy flux as it is the largest waterway connecting Puget Sound to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The site is approximately 6 kilometers (km) east of Port Townsend, and 1 km north of the Port Townsend -- Coupeville ferry route.

\end{figure}

The first mooring system was a simple fin suspended between a clump-weight anchor weighing 1200 kilograms (kg, dry) and a 0.93 m-diameter spherical steel buoy with a buoyancy of 320 kg. The ADVs pressure case (body) was hose-clamped to one side of the fin and the ADV sensor head was positioned in 10cm in front of the fin's leading edge (Figure \ref{fig:ttm:diagram}). The leading edge of the fin is fastened inline with the mooring line. This configuration  was designed to work similar to a weather-vane, such that the drag on the fin held the ADV head upstream of the mooring components. The ADVs were inclined at an angle of 18$^\circ$ to the leading edge of the fin to account for mooring blow-down during strong currents (Figure \ref{fig:ttm:photo}).

\end{figure}

The second mooring system was a cylindrical syntactic foam buoy that was anchored to a clump weight that weighed 2700 lbs (Figure \ref{fig:SM}). The buoy is 3.5 m long and 0.45 m in diameter with a tail ring that is 0.76 m in diameter. It weighs 295 kg in air, and has a buoyancy of 185 kg in water. An ADV head was positioned 0.1 m in front of the buoy nose.  The buoy was equipped with a 300 kHz RDI workhorse acoustic Doppler profiler that was pointed downward and configured to measure water velocity below the platform in \note{how many bins?} and measure buoy motion (`bottom tracking') at 1 Hz. The buoy platform was ballasted to pitch upward a few degrees in zero-flow to avoid `flying downward'. In the presence of an oncoming current the tail fins help to orient it into the flow. The anchor for this buoy is similar to that of the TTM, including an acoustic release so the mooring and anchor can be recovered separately. Additional details, photos, and schematic diagrams of both mooring systems are available in \cite{Harding_MotionPaper}.

\note{Need to describe the measurements for each data source.}

Periods of time during which the mooring interfered with a beam of the Doppler profiler were identified by inspection of the profiler's acoustic amplitude signal. Periods during which one beam of the profiler had $>5\%$ higher acoustic amplitude than the other beams were flagged as `contaminated' and excluded from averaging.  5-minute averages in which more than 50\% of the data was contaminated in this way are not shown.

\note{END: Add data sources}

Unless stated otherwise, vector quantities in this work are in a fixed `principal-axes' coordinate system that is aligned with the bi-directional tidal flow: positive $u$ is in the direction of ebb (310$\circ$ True), positive $w$ is vertically upward, and $v$ is the cross-stream component in a right-handed coordinate system. The full velocity vector, $\vec{\tilde{u}} = (\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}, \tilde{w})$, is separated into a mean and turbulent component as $\vec{\tilde{u}} = \vec{\bar{u}} + \vec{u}$, where--here and throughout this work--the over-bar denotes a 5 minute average.  All time series are linearly detrended and Hanning windowed prior to computing spectra to reduce spectral reddening. All spectra are computed as the variance preserving squared magnitude of the Fourier transform using standardized fast Fourier transform routines (i.e. $\int S(u)\mathrm{d}f = \overline{u^2}$).

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methods}

% The orientation matrix can be used to rotate all vector-quantities measured in the instrument frame (velocity, rotation rate, acceleration, etc.) into the earth's coordinate system. 
% The angular rate and linear acceleration signals can be used to estimate the ADV head-motion, $\uhead$, which can then be removed from the measured velocity, $\umeas$, to estimate the `motion corrected' velocity in the earth frame,
% Note that $\uhead$ is added to $\umeas$ because the measured velocity resulting from head motion is in the opposite direction of head motion itself (i.e., $\umeas = \ue - \uhead$).

Estimate time-series of velocity on a compliant mooring by obtaining an independent estimate of ADV head motion, and removing that motion from the measured signal. Nortek offers an ADV that is equipped with an IMU that measures the linear acceleration, rotational-motion, and orientation of the ADV pressure case (body). So long as the ADV head is rigidly connected to the ADV pressure case, it is possible to utilize the IMU motion signals to calculate the motion of the ADV head, and remove it from the measured velocity signal.  The ADV head motion, is calculated as the sum of rotational and translational motion, which are each estimated from the IMU's angular-rate, \AngRt, and acceleration, \Accel, signals as:
\begin{align}
  \uhead & = \urot + \uacc + \ulow \\
      & = \omatinv \cdot \AngRt^*(t)\times\l^* + \int \{\Accel(t)\}_{HP(f_{a})} \mathrm{d}t + \ulow
\end{align}
Here `$*$' superscripts denote quantities in the ADV's locale coordinate system, $\omatinv$ is the IMU orientation matrix that rotates vectors from the IMU to the earth reference frame, and $\l^*$ is the vector from the IMU to the ADV head. The notation $\{\Accel\}_{HP(f_a)}$ indicates that the IMU's accelerometer signal is high-pass filtered (in the earth's stationary reference frame) at a chosen filter-frequency, $f_a$. This is necessary because accelerometers have known low-frequency noise, sometimes referred to as `bias-drift' \citeneeded{Accelerometer noise}. This noise is amplified by integration of the acceleration signal such that it contaminates the motion correction, especially at low-frequencies (Figure \ref{fig:stationary_noise}).
% Do I need to say something about filtering out gravity here too?

% Bench-tests of the Microstrain IMU indicate that its accelerometers drift for frequencies $<10^{-2}$Hz (a minute or more, \cite{EgelandPhD2014}).  Therefore, in order to remove bias-drifts in $\vec{a}$ that--when integrated according to \eqref{eqn:uacc-def}--lead to large errors in $\uacc$ this document recommends using $f_a = 0.033$Hz (30seconds). 
% On the other hand, real motions at and below $f_a$ will not be accurately accounted for in $\uacc$, and will therefore persist as low-frequency motion contamination not corrected-for in the estimate of $\vec{u}$. 

% For moorings whose low-frequency motion is limited by the mooring line itself this is a reasonable approach.  
% Assuming that the displacement of the ADV head (from the mooring's neutral position) is likely to be  $< 20 \% $ of its distance from the bottom, then for ADVs deployed at 10m depth the speed of their low-frequency motion (i.e. below $ f_a = 0.03 $ Hz) will be $<0.07 \mathrm{m/s} $.  In other words, for a 10m mooring the choice of $f_a = 0.03$Hz allows for low-frequency motion contamination on the order of 7cm/s to persist.  This is a notable but relatively minor level of uncertainty in the context of the highly energetic flows that exist at tidal energy sites.

The choice of high-pass filter to be used to correct for low-frequency accelerometer noise issue depends on the application (e.g. deployment platform), and the turbulence level of the measurement environment. In particular, this involves a trade off between filtering-out this noise and not filtering measured motion (Figure \ref{fig:stationary_noise}). If an independent measure of low-frequency motion is available, it is possible to combine that signal with the IMU's high-frequency motion measurements to obtain a complete estimate of ADV motion. An example of this operation is presented in section \ref{sec:stablemoor_motion}. Lacking an independent measure of low-f motion, the user may instead choose to neglect the portion of the spectrum below the filter frequency, or demonstrate that platform motion at those frequencies is small compared to the measured signal based on other considerations.

The black horizontal dotted line indicates the noise-level of a Nortek Vector ADV configured to measure $\pm$4m/s. The shaded region indicates the range of spectra presented herein (0.002 $< \tke <$ 0.03 $\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$, 1e-5 $< \epsilon <$ 5e-4 $\mathrm{W/kg}$).}
\end{figure}

With this estimate of ADV head motion it is straightforward to correct the measured velocity, $\umeas$, to estimate the velocity in the earth's inertial reference frame:
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:u_mot_def}
  \ue(t) & = \umeas(t) + \uhead(t) &  .
\end{align}
Note here that the `+'-sign is correct because head motion, $\uhead$, induces a measured velocity in the opposite direction of the head motion itself ($\umeas = \ue - \uhead$).

\section{Results}

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{TimeFig02}
  \caption{Time series of tidal velocity at Admiralty Head from TTM measurements (black), and an acoustic Doppler profiler (red). The profiler measurements--taken at the same depth as the ADV on the TTM---were contaminated by acoustic reflection from the strongback fin when it was inline with one of the profiler's beams. Note that the vertical scale on the three axes vary by more than an order of magnitude (the small ticks in A and B are equivalent to the ticks in C).}
  \label{fig:vel_time}
\end{figure}

A comparison of mean velocity measured by an IMU-ADV mounted on a TTM, to that of an upward-looking acoustic Doppler profiler mounted on the TTM anchor is presented in Figure \ref{fig:vel_time}. This shows excellent agreement between the ADV and Doppler profiler measurements of velocity. The $u$, $v$ and $w$ components have a root-mean-square error of 0.05, 0.13 and 0.03 m/s, respectively. 
It is unclear why the $v$-component has a larger error than the others, but it may be due to side-lobe interference of an AWAC beam that was not captured by the screening methodology described in section \ref{sec:meas}. It is also possible that this discrepancy is due to incomplete motion correction that aliases into the mean signal.
%The $v$ component error is likely larger because the IMU's magnetometer provides a noisier estimate of heading than the accelerometers provide for vertical. 

The agreement between the magnitude and direction of these independent measurements indicates that the IMU provides an useful estimate of the ADV's orientation in the Earth's reference frame. This is a highly encouraging result considering most ADV manufacturers previously assumed these instruments would be stationary and therefore relied on slow-response orientation sensors.

The rows are for each component of velocity (top: $u$, middle: $v$, bottom: $w$). The uncorrected spectra are in black and the corrected spectra are blue. The spectra of ADV head motion, $\uhead$, is red. Diagonal dotted-lines indicate a $f^{-5/3}$ slope. N is the number of spectral-ensembles in each column.}
  \label{fig:spec01}
\end{figure*}

As discussed in detail in the companion paper, the mooring motion of the TTM has a peak at 0.1 to 0.2 Hz from swaying of the mooring that is most likely driven by eddy-shedding from the spherical buoy (Figure \ref{fig:spec01}, red lines). There is also broad-band motion that is especially energetic in the $v$-component spectra that is likely associated with fluttering of the strongback fin. As would be expected from basic fluid-structure interaction theory the amplitude of these motions increases with increasing mean velocity \citeneeded{motion increasing with fluid velocity?}.

The mooring motion contaminates the uncorrected ADV-measurements of velocity, \spec{\umeas}, whenever the amplitude of the motion is similar to or greater than the amplitude of the turbulence. Fortunately, much of this motion can be removed using the IMU's motion signals as detailed in section \ref{sec:methods}. Lacking an independent measurement of turbulence velocity at this site, we interpret the agreement of these spectra with turbulence theory as evidence of the success of the method. In particular, for each mean-flow the measurements seem to measure an inertial subrange where the spectra decay with a $f^{-5/3}$ slope, and have equal amplitude (i.e. the spectra are isotropic).

Furthermore, are consistent with similar measurements of turbulence in energetic tidal channels from stationary platforms \citep[]{Thomson++2010} \citeneeded{are there more citations here? Should I add a fig from the TTT}. They have constant amplitude at low frequencies, and roll off to a $f^{-5/3}$ slope at high frequencies that is consistent with Kolmogorov's theory of locally isotropic turbulence \citep[]{Kolmogorov1941c}. 

Figure \ref{fig:spec01} presents motion-corrected spectra from the Tidal Turbulence Mooring (blue), and compares them with the uncorrected spectra (black) and the spectra of ADV head motion (red) for different mean-flow speeds.  

This motion contaminates the uncorrected $u$ and $v$ spectra for all ranges of the mean velocity, and begins to contaminate the $w$ spectra as the mean velocity increases beyond 2 m/s.
