The buoy was ballasted to pitch upward a few degrees in zero-flow to avoid ``flying downward''. In the presence of an oncoming current, the tail fins help to orient it into the flow. The anchor for this buoy is similar to that of the TTM, including an acoustic release so the mooring and anchor can be recovered separately.
