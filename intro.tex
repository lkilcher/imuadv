\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Brief history of ADVs
\item Discussion of ADV v. ADP measurement
\item ADVs have been difficult to deploy at mid-depths
\item Availability of cheap+accurate IMUs (from smartphone tech) facilitates a new era of ADV measurement from moored platforms.
\item Emphasize noise issue and spatial smearing of ADPs.
\item Reference to `Part 1'.
\item This work developed for MHK, but has wider applications.
