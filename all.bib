The mixing and entrainment mechanisms at the shear interface are explored with the use of imaging techniques. The initial, unstable accelerating region, characterized by rapid development, low shear layer Richardson numbers and high entrainment rates, is limited by the effects of stratification which suppress the large-scale overturning. A subsequent high Richardson number region is characterized by weak entrainment and the collapse of turbulence from the initial region. The flow approaches a quasi-stable state as the mixed layer draws energy from the accelerating density current. Observed large-scale structure is attributed to an instability of the marginally unstable shear layer. Entrainment rates are calculated within each region for the various slopes considered and estimates for the extent of the transition regions are obtained.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract The relative strength and spatiotemporal structure of near-inertial waves (NIW) and internal tides (IT) are examined in the context of recent moored observations made 19 km south of Mendocino Escarpment, an abrupt ridge/step feature in the eastern Pacific. In addition to strong internal tide generation, steps and ridges give rise to the possibility of “shadowing,” wherein near-inertial energy is prevented from reaching depths beneath a characteristic intersecting the ridge top. A combination of two moored profilers and a long-range acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) yielded velocity and shear measurements from 100 to 3640 m (60 m above bottom) and isopycnal depth, strain, and overturn-inferred turbulence dissipation rate from 1000 to 3640 m. Sampling intervals (20 min in the upper 1000 m and 1.5 h below that) were fast enough to minimize aliasing of higher-frequency internal-wave motions. The 67-day-long record is easily sufficient to isolate NIW and IT via bandpass filtering and to capture low-frequency variability in all quantities. No near-inertial shadowing was observed. Instead, energetic near-inertial waves were observed at all depths, radiating both upward and downward. A strong upward internal tide beam, showing a pronounced spring–neap cycle, was also seen near the expected depth. Case studies of each of these are presented in depth and isopycnal-following coordinates. Except for immediately above the bottom and in the “beam,” where IT kinetic energy shows marked peaks, kinetic energy in the two bands is within a factor of 2 of each other. However, because of the redder NIW vertical wavenumber spectrum, NIW shear exceeded IT shear at all depths by a factor of 2–4. Dissipation rate was strongly enhanced in the bottom 1000 m and in the depth range of the internal tide beam. However, except for very near the bottom and possibly in one NIW event, no clear phase relationship was observed between dissipation rate and wave shear or strain, suggesting that turbulence occurs through a cascade process rather than by direct breaking at most locations. },

  abstract  = {Pyroclastic flows and snow avalanches sometimes exhibit a rapid deceleration of their dense flow fronts and detachment of their dilute clouds. This behavior is also inferred for submarine flows and could explain stepped thickness patterns in their deposits. A similar ``abrupt transition'' process occurs in particle-laden, lock release laboratory currents with relatively high concentrations. New experiments on nonparticulate, solute-driven density currents were run to investigate the cause of abrupt transitions. Abrupt transitions occur in laboratory currents with Reynolds numbers (Re) less than 1000 and are interpreted, supported by theoretical scaling analysis, to signify a change in dynamic regime. Currents with high Re, which do not show abrupt transitions, undergo a downstream change in dynamic regime from (1) inertial slumping to (2) inertial-buoyancy spreading to (3) viscous-buoyancy spreading. In low Re currents that undergo abrupt transitions, however, the duration of the second regime is very short, and hence they appear to pass directly from the quickly moving slumping phase into the slowly moving viscous phase. Scaling analysis indicates that an abrupt transition should occur in currents below a critical value of Re of ~10-5000 for currents with different initial aspect ratios. Given that natural flows typically have greater Reynolds numbers, we suggest that abrupt transitions in laboratory and natural currents are likely to be dynamically different. This work has important implications for the physical modeling of gravity flows.},

  abstract  = {This paper addresses how the geometrical parameters (ambient ocean depth, H; bottom slope, &#945;) of coastal bathymetry affect the evolution of buoyant coastal currents flowing over a sloping continental shelf. Scaling arguments are presented that show the coastal current dynamics can be classified by a two-variable nondimensional parameter space: the ambient depth parameter, h/H, and the bottom slope parameter, R/yb. The ratio h/H is the fraction of the available depth occupied by the buoyant layer; the bottom slope parameter is the ratio of two horizontal length scales, the internal Rossby radius R to the bottom-trapped width yb. The scale depth h is derived from geostrophic dynamics and is representative of the depth of the buoyant layer of the coastal current. The resulting parameter space is delineated by surface-advected currents that do not depend upon the bottom slope parameter and bottom-trapped currents that do. For bottom-trapped coastal currents, the across-shore width and downstream velocities are dependent upon the magnitude of the bottom slope parameter, R/yb. The bottom slope parameter is also a ratio of the buoyant layer isopycnal slope to the shelf slope. Experiments are conducted in the laboratory in order to test the scaling. Measurements of coastal current width and nose velocities are taken, together with mean density cross sections, for a number of coastal currents. Experimental observations and oceanic datasets are examined in terms of the proposed scaling arguments; it is shown that these experimental measurements and oceanic observations are in accord.},

  abstract  = {Hydrographic and current profiler data taken during the 1988 Gulf of Cadiz Expedition have been analyzed to diagnose the mixing, spreading, and descent of the Mediterranean outflow. The u-S properties and the thickness and width of the outflow were similar to that seen in earlier surveys. The transport of pure Mediterranean Water (i.e., water with S >= 38.4 psu) was estimated to be about 0.4 3 106 m3 s21, which is lower than historical estimates-most of which were indirect-but comparable to other recent estimates made from direct velocity observations. The outflow transport estimated at the west end of the Strait of Gibraltar was about 0.7 3 106 m3 s21 of mixed water, and the transport increased to about 1.9 3 106 m3 s21 within the eastern Gulf of Cadiz. This increase in transport occurred by entrainment of fresher North Atlantic Central Water, and the salinity anomaly of the outflow was consequently reduced. The velocity.weighted salinity decreased to 36.7 psu within 60 km of the strait and decreased by about another 0.1 before the deeper portion of the outflow began to separate from of the bottom near Cape St. Vincent. Entrainment appears to have been correlated spatially with the initial descent of the continental slope and with the occurrence of bulk Froude numbers slightly greater than 1. In the western Gulf of Cadiz, where entrainment was much weaker, Froude numbers were consistently well below 1. The outflow began in the eastern Strait of Gibraltar as a narrow (10 km wide) current having a very narrow range of u–S properties. The outflow broadened as it descended the continental slope of the northern Gulf of Cadiz and reached a maximum width of 80 km in the western Gulf of Cadiz. The descent of the outflow was very asymmetric: The southern (offshore) edge of the outflow descended about 1000 m from Gibraltar to Cape St. Vincent, while the northern (onshore) edge of the outflow descended only a few hundred meters. The northern, onshore side thus remained considerably higher in the water column and thus entrained relatively warm North Atlantic Central Water. This caused the outflow to develop horizontal u-S variability and, by about 140 km downstream, the across-stream variation in temperature on an isopycnal was more than 28C. Much of the volume transport in the western Gulf of Cadiz was contained within two preferred modes or cores. The deeper, offshore core had a central su 5 27.8 kg m23, and the shallower onshore core, which was still in contact with the bottom in the Gulf of Cadiz, had a central su 5 27.5 kg m23. These two cores develop as a result of the spreading and horizontally varying entrainment noted above, combined with topographic steering.},

  abstract  = {Field data taken in the Gulf of Cadiz have been analyzed to describe some aspects of the momentum and energy balance of the Mediterranean outflow. A crucial component of the momentum balance is the total stress (entrainment stress and bottom drag), which has been estimated from a form of the Bernoulli function evaluated from density and current observations. For the first 60 km west of the Camarinal Sill the outflow was confined within a narrow channel on the continental shelf. At about 70 km downstream the outflow crossed over the shelf–slope break and began to descend the continental slope. The buoyancy force increased substantially, and the outflow underwent a geostrophic adjustment, albeit one heavily influenced by mixing and dissipation. The current direction turned 90 degrees to the right at a near-inertial rate. In this region, the estimated geostrophic velocity greatly underestimated the actual current, and the estimated curvature Rossby number was about 0.5. Current speeds were in excess of 1 m s21 and the total stress was as large as 5 Pa. The entrainment stress, estimated independently from property fluxes, reached a maximum of about 1 Pa, or considerably smaller than the inferred bottom stress. By about 130 km downstream, the current was aligned approximately along the local topography. The current amplitude and the estimated stress were then much less, about 0.3 m s21 and 0.3 Pa. The entrainment stress was also very small in this region well downstream of the strait. This slightly damped geostrophic flow continued on to Cape St. Vincent where the outflow began to separate from the bottom. Bottom stress thus appears to be a crucial element in the dynamics of the Mediterranean outflow, allowing or causing the outflow to descend more than a kilometer into the North Atlantic. In the regions of strongest bottom stress the inferred drag coefficient was about 2 2 12 (3 10 23) depending upon which outflow speed is used in the usual quadratic form. Entrainment stress was small by comparison to the bottom stress, but the entrainment effect upon the density anomaly was crucial in eroding the density anomaly of the outflow. The observed entrainment rate appears to follow, roughly, a critical internal Froude number function.},

His purpose is to clarify and consolidate the primary physical concepts of two-layer gravity currents, as well as debunk erroneous theories.

Estimates of the strait mixing are made from published estimates of the overflows and the difference between Antarctic Bottom Water densities across the Vema Channel and the Romanche Fracture Zone to demonstrate that the strait mixing is an order of magnitude larger than the abyssal mixing estimated for a standard diffusivity of 1 3 1024 m2 s21.},

It is based on the one-dimensional reduced-gravity shallow-watertheory generalized to a three-dimensional orography with moderate streamwisevariations by introducing a variable effective flow cross-section. In this way,the hydraulic jump and gap flow are accommodated within the same model. Theresulting steady hyperbolic problem is shown to require the boundaryconditions to be expressed in terms of Riemann invariants. The latter yield the flow betweentwo given sites in a unique way. In particular, it is possible to relateunambiguously the existence of a hydraulic jump/gap flow and its energydiscontinuity to the boundary conditions. A simple method of flow interpolationand energy discontinuity calculation between two sites is presented.},

Two cases are considered: gravity currents propagating along a rigid boundary and intrusive gravity currents. For the first case, a semi-empirical formula for the front propagation speed derived from simple energy arguments is shown to capture well the effect of flow deceleration because of viscous dissipation. In the second case, the propagation speed is shown to agree with the one predicted for energy-conserving virtually inviscid flows (Shin, Dalziel & Linden, J. Fluid Mech. vol. 521, 2004, p. 1), which implies that the losses due to vorticity generation and mixing at the liquid liquid interface play only a minor role in the total balance of energy.},

  Abstract                 = { AbstractAn internally recording, autonomous instrument has been tested for measurements of ocean turbulence from a mooring line. Measurements were made at a single level in the water column, but for an extended period of time, at a predetermined duty cycle. The instrument is designed to measure, independently, in two different parts of the turbulence wavenumber spectrum: eddy correlation measurements in the inertial subrange and small-scale shear and temperature gradient measurements in the dissipation subrange using shear probes and fast-response thermistors. For the deployment reported here, the instrument is located in the wave-affected layer, and only the dissipation subrange from the shear probes can be confidently utilized for turbulence measurements. The velocity spectra in the inertial subrange are severely contaminated by platform motion and noise, and the dissipation range of the temperature gradient spectrum is not satisfactorily resolved. The shear spectra are found to be relatively free of contamination in the 1–20-Hz frequency range and are used for dissipation rate calculations. The quality of the measurements is constrained by the angle of attack and the magnitude of mean flow relative to the wave oscillatory velocities. Dissipation rates are consistent with a scaling expected from breaking long waves, when background shear is weak, and are elevated when the gradient Richardson number is small, consistent with additional turbulence production by shear. While limited to a single depth, the instrument makes it possible to collect time series for 3 weeks continuously or for 3 months at a 25\% duty cycle. },

  abstract  = {If a sill-enclosed basin, connected to a large reservoir, is suddenly subjected to a de-stabilizing surface buoyancy flux, it will first mix vertically by turbulent convection before the resulting lateral buoyancy gradient generates a horizontal exchange flow across the sill. We present a study which examines the unsteady adjustment of such a basin under continued steady forcing. It is shown, through theoretical development and laboratory experimentation, that two consecutive unsteady regimes characterized by different dynamic balances are traversed as the flow approaches a steady state.},

  abstract  = {Experiments are reported on the sustained release of saline and particle-laden fluid into a long, but relatively narrow, flume, filled with fresh water. The dense fluid rapidly spread across the flume and flowed away from the source: the motion was then essentially two-dimensional. In the absence of a background flow in the flume, the motion was symmetric, away from the source. However, in the presence of a background flow the upstream speed of propagation was slowed and the downstream speed was increased. Measurements of this motion are reported and, when the excess density was due to the presence of suspended sediment, the distribution of the deposited particles was also determined. Alongside this experimental programme, new theoretical models of the motion were developed. These were based upon multi-layered depth-averaged shallow-water equations, in which the interfacial drag and mixing processes were explicitly modelled. While the early stages of the motion are independent of these interfacial phenomena to leading order, they play an increasingly important dynamical role as the the flow is slowed, or even arrested. In addition a new integral model is proposed. This does not resolve the interior dynamics of the flow, but may be readily integrated and obviates the need for more lengthy numerical calculations. It is shown that the predictions from both the shallow-layer and integral models are in close agreement with the experimental observations.},

  volume    = {501},
  pages     = {179--212},
  abstract  = {The effects of resistive forces on unsteady shallow flows over rigid horizontal boundaries are investigated theoretically. The dynamics of this type of motion are driven by the streamwise gradient of the hydrostatic pressure, which balances the inertia of the fluid and the basal resistance. Drag forces are often negligible provided the fluid is sufficiently deep. However, close to the front of some flows where the depth of the moving layer becomes small, it is possible for drag to substantially influence the motion. Here we consider three aspects of unsteady shallow flows. First we consider a regime in which the drag, inertia and buoyancy (pressure gradient) are formally of the same magnitude throughout the entire current and we construct a new class of similarity solutions for the motion. This reveals the range of solution types possible, which includes those with continuous profiles, those with discontinuous profiles and weak shocks and those which are continuous but have critical points of transition at which the gradients may be discontinuous. Next we analyse one-dimensional dam-break flow and calculate how drag slows the motion. There is always a region close to the front in which drag forces are not negligible. We employ matched asymptotic expansions to combine the flow at the front with the flow in the bulk of the domain and derive theoretical predictions that are compared to laboratory measurements of dam-break flows. Finally we investigate a modified form of dam-break flow in which the vertical profile of the horizontal velocity field is no longer assumed to be uniform. It is found that in the absence of drag it is no longer possible to find a kinematically consistent front of the fluid motion. However the inclusion of drag forces within the region close to the front resolves this difficulty. We calculate velocity and depth profiles within the drag-affected region, and obtain the leading-order expression for the rate at which the fluid propagates when the magnitude of the drag force is modelled using Chézy, Newtonian and power-law fluid closures; this compares well with experimental data and provide new insights into dam-break flows.},

  abstract  = {The influence of drag on the motion of gravity currents over rigid horizontal surfaces is considered analytically using a Chézy model of boundary shear stress. Although the initial motion is governed by a balance between the buoyancy forces and fluid inertia, drag gradually influences the flow. The length and time scales at which these effects become significant are identified. A perturbation series, valid at early times, is constructed to analyse the changes to the velocity and height of the evolving current due to drag. At much later times, a new class of similarity solutions is developed to model the motion which is now governed by a balance between buoyancy and drag. The transition in the dominant forces which govern the dynamics of the flow is examined by numerically integrating the equations of motion for flows generated by a constant flux of relatively dense fluid. The numerical results confirm both the perturbation solution, valid at early times, and the new similarity solution valid at late times. The transition between the two may involve the formation of a discontinuity (bore). Finally particle-driven currents, which exhibit different dynamical behaviour due to the progressive reduction of their density arising from particle sedimentation, are investigated.},

  abstract  = {The deep circulation in the South Atlantic is studied through numerical experiments, using an oceanic general circulation model based on z coordinates. The new feature of these numerical experiments is that diapycnal mixing is idealized as strong bottom-intensified mixing on both sides of the midocean ridge; elsewhere diapycnal mixing is set at a low background value. The bottom-intensified diapycnal mixing induces strong equatorward (poleward) flow along the western (eastern) slope of the midocean ridge. In addition, the strong vertical gradient of diapycnal mixing rate induces downwelling in the basin interior and intensifies the upwelling near the axis of the midocean ridge. The strong ridge-following currents induce anticlockwise circulation in both the eastern and western deep basins, and such circulation is opposite to the classical Stommel-Arons circulation. This study indicates that bottom topography, strong mixing over the midocean ridge, and strong localized mixing associated with overflows can have major impact on the strength of the deep meridional overturning cell and deep water properties in the whole deep basin.},

  abstract  = {Gravity currents, driven by horizontal differences in buoyancy, play a central role in fluid mechanics, with numerous important natural and industrial applications. The first quantitative, fluid-mechanical study of gravity currents, by von Kármán in 1940, was carried out before the birth of this Journal; the next important theoretical contribution was in 1968 by Brooke Benjamin, and appeared in this Journal more than a decade after its birth. The present paper reviews some of the material that has built on this auspicious start. Part of the fun and satisfaction of being involved in this field is that its development has been based on both theoretical and experimental contributions, which have at times been motivated and supported by field observations and measurements.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents measurements of the turbulent dissipation rate collected during the Hawaiian Ocean Mixing Experiment. We found that dissipation had a structure that tended to increase the diffusivity near the sea floor, and with distance from the ridge crest. A weak spring-neap cycle was found, with dissipation changing by a factor of two, or approximately linearly with the tidal velocities. A kinematic relationship between the internal tide energy and the depth integrated dissipation was found so that the dissipation was proportional to the square root of the energy. This relation is corroborated by a simple "knife-edge" model and wave_wave interaction theory. The observed dissipation is extrapolated along the ridge to give a rough estimate of the dissipation near 7.5+/-3 GW.},

  abstract  = {Strong internal waves (IW) in the form of soliton groups were observed off the Oregon coast with in situ and remote sensors, including shore-based X band and Ka band Doppler radars and an airborne microwave radiometer operating at 37 GHz. Here we analyze the relationships between oceanic isotherm vertical displacements, internal currents, and radar backscatter cross sections, along with Doppler velocity signals at horizontal (HH) and vertical (VV) polarizations, and 37-GHz brightness temperatures measured at intermediate incidence angles from an airship. Analysis of these observations shows that (1) the horizontal spatial structure of the IW field depends on whether it is forced by a strong (spring) tide or weak (neap) tide; (2) while both HH and VV are strongly modulated by IWs, the modulation depth of HH always exceeds that of VV, and they both increase with the IW amplitude; (3) 37-GHz brightness temperature modulations were in phase with radar signal modulations; and (4) the phase of radar signal modulation with respect to the IW is such that the minimum radar signal intensity and lowest microwave brightness temperature lie close to the maximum of the IW thermocline depression or, equivalently, the horizontal current excursion near the surface. This last observation conflicts with the expectation that the highest backscattered signal would be found near the region of greatest surface strain rate (the surface current gradient). Existing theoretical models are briefly reviewed for interactions between the IW field and the intensity of short gravity-capillary waves that might be responsible for this behavior.},

  abstract  = {Flows between ocean basins are often controlled by narrow channels and shallow sills. A multi-layer hydraulic control theory is developed for exchange flow through such constrictions. The theory is based on the inviscid shallow-water equations and extends the functional approach introduced by Gill (1977) and developed by Dalziel (1991). The flows considered are those in rectangular cross-section channels connecting two large reservoirs, with a single constriction (sill and/or narrows). The exchange flow depends on the stratification in the two reservoirs, represented as a finite number of immiscible layers of (different) uniform density. For most cases the flow is `controlled' at the constriction and often at other points along the channel (virtual controls) too. As with one- and two-layer hydraulics, controls are locations at which the flow passes from one solution branch to another, and at which (at least) one internal wave mode is stationary. The theory is applied to three-layer flows, which have two internal wave modes, predicting interface heights and layer fluxes from the given reservoir conditions. The theoretical results for three-layer flows are compared to a comprehensive set of laboratory experiments and found to give good agreement. The laboratory experiments also show other features of the flow, such as the formation of waves on the interfaces. The implications of the results for oceanographic flows and ocean modelling are discussed.},

  abstract  = {The overturning circulation of the ocean plays an important role in modulating the Earth's climate. But whereas the mechanisms for the vertical transport of water into the deep ocean - deep water formation at high latitudes and horizontal transport in ocean currents have been largely identifed, it is not clear how the compensating vertical transport of water from the depths to the surface is accomplished. Turbulent mixing across surfaces of constant density is the only viable mechanism for reducing the density of the water and enabling it to rise. However, measurements of the internal wave field, the main source of energy for mixing, and of turbulent dissipation rates, have typically implied diffusivities across surfaces of equal density of only ,0.1 cm2 s-1, too small to account for the return ¯ow. Here we report measurements of tracer dispersion and turbulent energy dissipation in the Brazil basin that reveal diffusivities of 2+/-4 cm2 s-1 at a depth of 500m above abyssal hills on the ¯ank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and approximately 10 cm2 s-1 nearer the bottom. This amount of mixing, probably driven by breaking internal waves that are generated by tidal currents ¯owing over the rough bathymetry, may be large enough to close the buoyancy budget for the Brazil basin and suggests a mechanism for closing the global overturning circulation.},

  abstract  = {Recent idealized studies have shown that both explicit horizontal diffusion and the implicit diffusion associated with the advection scheme in high-resolution z-coordinate models may drive unrealistically high rates of diapycnal mixing. The aim here is to see whether the diapycnal mixing associated with the advection scheme in a global eddy-permitting (¼8 by ¼8) z-level model is sufficiently strong to corrupt the thermohaline circulation. This paper diagnoses the diapycnal fluxes by using the ideas of water mass transformation. In the Southern Ocean, the model deep and bottom waters drift rapidly away from the Levitus climatology, with dense isopycnals moving downward at rates of up to 35 m yr21. The strong upward flux (up to 50 Sv) through the dense isopycnals cannot be explained by the incorrect surface forcing (as a result of poor surface fluxes and no ice model) as most of the anomalous diapycnal fluxes are occurring in the deep ocean far from surface forcing. Hence, the excessive diapycnal flux is driven by diffusion in the model, both explicit and implicit. The "effective" diapycnic diffusivity driven by the numerical diffusion (associated with the horizontal advection scheme) is found to be the same order, 1-10 cm2 s21, as that driven by the explicit horizontal diffusion. For strong vertical velocities (;20 m day21) as in models forced by high frequency winds, the vertical advection scheme also gives similar effective diffusivities. These effective diffusivities are considerably greater than suggested by observations. To alleviate these problems, it is suggested that eddy-resolving z-level climate models will require 1) less diffusive horizontal advection schemes and 2) better vertical resolution throughout much of the water column.},

It was observed that a wind-driven anticlockwise diurnal-period vertical mode one Kelvin wave generated large scale motions within the water column, and that the interactions between this wave and the sloping lakebed induced TBBLs. A simple model, based on potential energy change and boundary shearing, was shown to describe the mean TBBL thickness.},

  abstract  = {Observations of the buoyant coastal current that flows southward from Chesapeake Bay are used to describe how the thickness, width, and propagation speed vary in response to changes in the along-shelf wind stress. Three basic regimes were observed depending on the strength of the wind. For weak wind stresses (from -0.02 to 0.02 Pa), the buoyant coastal current was relatively thin, the front slope was not steep, and the width was variable (1–20 km). For moderate downwelling (southward) wind stresses (0.02– 0.07 Pa), wind-driven cross-shelf advection steepened the front, causing the plume to narrow and thicken. For stronger downwelling wind stresses (greater than 0.07 Pa), vertical mixing dominated, bulk Richardson numbers were approximately 0.25, isopycnals were nearly vertical, and the plume front widened but the plume width did not change. Plume thickness and width were normalized by the theoretical plume scales in the absence of wind forcing. Normalized plume thickness increased linearly from 1 to 2 as downwelling wind stresses increased from 0 to 0.2 Pa. Normalized plume widths were approximately 1 for downwelling wind stresses from 0.02 to 0.2 Pa. The observed along-shelf propagation speed of the plume was roughly equal to the sum of the theoretical propagation speed and the wind-driven along-shelf flow.},

Although shear spectra were strongly contaminated by narrowband vibrations produced by the motor and actuators, this contamination was highly coherent with the measured acceleration and was removed with standard signal processing techniques. The corrected spectra agreed well with the Nasmyth universal spectrum for wavenumbers up to 40 cpm. The estimated rate of dissipation of kinetic energy varied from 0.8 to 250 3 1028 W kg21 and was consistent with the rate of production of turbulence by surface wind forcing and bottom stress.},

The same result holds in strongly stratified situations as long as the generated disturbances in the neighborhood of the head do not propagate away. Classical density currents occur in weak stratification, multiheaded density currents in intermediate stratification, and multiheaded density currents with solitary wave&#8211;like or borelike disturbances propagating ahead of the current in strong stratification.In the second case, the upper-layer stratification consistently reduces the density-current height and its propagation speed. The simulated system resembles laboratory density currents and is not much affected by the overlying stratification.Finally, in continuously stratified flow, the effect of stratification is similar to the second case. The density current becomes shallower and moves more slowly as the stratification is increased. The modeled system has the basic features of density currents if the stratification is weak or moderate, but it becomes progressively less elevated as stratification increases. In strong stratification the density current assumes a wedgelike structure.The simulation results are compared with the authors&#8217; previously obtained analytical results, and the physical mechanisms for the effect of stratification are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Laboratory experiments were performed in which an intrusive gravity current was observed using shadowgraph and particle tracking methods. The intrusion was generated in a two-layer fluid with a sharp interface by mixing the fluid behind a vertical lock gate and then suddenly withdrawing the gate from the tank. The purpose of the experiments was to determine the structure of the velocity field inside the intrusion and the stability characteristics of the interface. Soon after the removal of the lock gate, the front of the intrusive gravity current travelled at a constant speed close to the value predicted by theory for an energy-conserving gravity current. The observed structure of the flow inside the intrusion can be divided into three regions. At the front of the intrusion there is an energy-conserving head region in which the fluid velocity is nearly uniform with speed equal to the front speed. This is followed by a dissipative wake region in which large billows are present with their associated mixing and in which the fluid velocity is observed to be non-uniform and have a maximum speed approximately 50% greater than the front speed. Behind the wake region is a tail region in which there is very little mixing and the velocity field is nearly uniform with a speed slightly faster than the front speed.},

  abstract  = {The adjustment of estuarine circulation and density to changes in river flow and tidal mixing is investigated using analytical and numerical models. Tidally averaged momentum and salinity equations in a rectangular estuary are vertically averaged over two levels, resulting in equations that are analytically tractable while retaining a broad range of time-dependent behavior. It is found that both strongly stratified and well-mixed estuaries respond rapidly to either type of forcing change, while those of intermediate stratification respond more slowly. Intermediate estuaries also have the greatest sensitivity to change. Exchange flow dominates the up-estuary salt flux in strongly stratified cases. Changing the river flow in such cases leads to an internal wave propagating the length of the estuary, which accomplishes much of the adjustment. The internal wave speed thus controls the adjustment time. Increased tidal mixing in strongly stratified cases initially decreases the exchange flow contribution to up-estuary salt flux by decreasing both the stratification and the vertical current shear. However, the decreased up-estuary salt flux leads to a loss of total salt in the estuary, and hence a greater longitudinal salinity gradient. The increasing gradient eventually restores the exchange-flow salt flux to near its original value.Well-mixed solutions have an advective–diffusive balance between river flow and longitudinal tidal mixing. In these cases the adjustment time corresponds to the time it takes the depth-averaged flow to travel the length scale of the salt intrusion, a result that applies to both types of changes considered In all cases the adjustment depends upon the dynamical feedback between the longitudinal salt flux and the longitudinal salinity gradient, which varies as the estuary gains or loses total salt.},

Fluid Mech. vol. 31, 1968, p. 209) and the steady-state dissipationless theory of rotating gravity currents of Hacker (PhD thesis, 1996). The theory assumes the fluid is inviscid, there is no shear within the current, and the Boussinesq approximation is made. Dissipation is introduced using a simple method. A head loss term is introduced into the Bernoulli equation and it is assumed that the energy loss is uniform across the stream. Conservation of momentum, volume flux and potential vorticity between upstream and downstream locations is then considered. By allowing for energy dissipation, results are obtained for channels of arbitrary depth and width (relative to the current). The results match those from earlier workers in the two limits of (i) zero rotation (but including dissipation) and (ii) zero dissipation (but including rotation). Three types of flow are identified as the effect of rotation increases, characterized in terms of the location of the outcropping interface between the gravity current and the ambient fluid on the channel boundaries. The parameters for transitions between these cases are quantified, as is the detailed behaviour of the flow in all cases. In particular, the speed of the current can be predicted for any given channel depth and width. As the channel depth increases, the predicted Froude number tends to surd 2, as for non-rotating flows.},

  abstract  = {An extension to the energy-conserving theory of gravity currents in rectangular rotating channels is presented, in which an upstream potential vorticity boundary condition in the current is applied. It is assumed that the fluid is inviscid; that the Boussinesq approximation applies; that the fundamental properties of momentum, energy, volume flux and potential vorticity are conserved between upstream and downstream locations; and that the flow is dissipationless. The upstream potential vorticity in the current is set through the introduction of a new parameter delta, that defines the ratio of the reference depth of the current to the ambient fluid. Flow types are established as a function delta and the rotation rate, and a fourth flow geometry is identified in addition to the three previously identified for rotating gravity currents. Detailed solutions are obtained for three cases delta {=} 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5, where delta {<} 1 is relevant to currents originating from a shallow source and delta {>} 1 to currents where the source region is deeper than the downstream depth, for example where a deep ocean flow encounters a plateau. The governing equations and solutions for each case are derived, quantifying the flow in terms of the depth, width and front speed. Cross-stream velocity profiles are provided for both the ambient fluid and the current. These predict the evolution of a complex circulation within the current as the rotation rate is varied. The ambient fluid exhibits similar trends to those predicted by the energy-conserving theory, with the Froude number tending to surd 2 at the right-hand wall at high rotation rates. The introduction of the potential vorticity boundary condition into the energy-conserving theory does not appear to have a substantial effect on the main flow parameters (such as current speed and width); however it does provide an insight into the complex dynamics of the flow within the current.},

We show that the similarity solution is stable to sufficiently small perturbations by proving that all perturbation eigenfunctions decay in time. Moreover, asymmetric perturbations are shown to decay more rapidly than axisymmetric perturbations in general. An asymptotic formula for the eigenvalues is derived, which indicates that asymptotic rates of decay of perturbations are given by t(-sigma) where 0 {<} sigma {<} (1)/(4) as the Froude number decreases from sqrt2 to 0. We demonstrate that this formula agrees closely with numerically calculated eigenvalues and, in the absence of azimuthal dependence, it reduces to an expression that improves on the asymptotic formula obtained by Grundy & Rottman (1985). For two-dimensional (planar) currents, we further prove analytically that all perturbation eigenfunctions decay like t(-{1/2}) .},

  abstract  = {Steady-state analytic models establish two key points concerning the impact of vertical shear on density currents and the implication for convection initiation. First, shear decreases the horizontal convergence, and therefore the mean ascent, associated with downshear propagating currents. Second, shear has a basic effect on the dynamical organization. If the downshear current travels at the speed of the ambient flow at a critical (steering) level, an overturning circulation provides deep lifting. Although mean ascent is increased by shear in the case of upshear propagating currents, the lifting is comparatively shallow because jumplike ascent occurs rather than deep overturning. The convection initiation mechanism involving the downshear current is therefore very different from the upshear case.These basic principles are borne out in two-dimensional numerical simulations. Density currents generated by a stationary cold source imposed on an initially horizontally homogeneous, sheared, and neutrally stratified ambient flow are explored. Results show that (i) if the surface flow and low-level shear vectors are in the same direction, as in a low-level jet, the effects of shear and surface flow on the density current head height counteract one another; and (ii) if they oppose one another, as in a surface jet, both conspire to lower the density current head on the downwind side but raise it on the upwind side.As regards convection initiation by sea breezes, point (i) above shows an approximately equal but weak preference for convection exists on the leeward and windward coasts. Point (ii) shows that initiation is strongly suppressed on the windward coast, but strongly enhanced on the leeward one. The hypothesis that sea breezes are more intense in offshore flow therefore holds only if shear and surface flow have opposite sign or if the flow is unsheared.Concerning convection initiation by thunderstorm outflows, downshear propagating outflows provide the deepest lifting if they move at the speed of the ambient flow at a critical level, despite the fact that low-level convergence is decreased by shear. While shear strengthens the mean ascent in upshear propagating outflows there is no steering level to anchor the incipient convection to the organized ascent.},

  note      = {Submitted},
  year      = {2008},
  abstract  = {Large-amplitude nonlinear internal waves (NLIWs) are frequently observed propagat-ing away from the {C}olumbia {R}iver tidal plume front. They are generated during the de-celeration of the frontal bulge. Cruise vessel observations indicate that in the presence of strong ambient velocity shear, the maximum amplitude of the NLIW structure function appear well below the density interface on which the NLIWs is traveling, and at a deeper depth than in the absence of shear. The Observations of NLIW properties are based on density profiles, ADCP velocities and ADCP beam echo intensity, all obtained by a towed sled during the RISE (River Influences on Shelf Ecosystems) project. The effects of ambient shear on NLIW dynamic characteristics can be analyzed using a high-order KdV model forced by an ambient velocity field described by three parameters: the sur-face layer ambient velocity (U0), the depth of the maximum ambient velocity shear (hU), and the shear depth range (thickness) $\delta$hU. RISE vessel data show there are two depth ranges associated with density overturns and vertical mixing. Dynamic analysis reveals that the overturns correspond to the depths with the gradient Richardson number Rig less than a critical value of ~0.25. The nonlinear interaction between ambient shear and the NLIWs is responsible for velocity shear inten-sification and causes Rig to decrease below the critical value. In addition, due to the pres-ence of ambient velocity shear, the maximum NLIW velocity shear occurs at a depth be-low the interface where there is less stratification, which enhances the NLIW-induced turbulent mixing. The Rig calculated from the in-situ measurements is consistent with the results of the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract  = {The baroclinic tides play a significant role in the energy budget of the abyssal ocean. Although the basic principles of generation and propagation are known, a clear understanding of these phenomena in the complex ocean environment is only now emerging. To advance this effort, a ray model is developed that quantifies the effects of spatially variable topography, stratification, and planetary vorticity on the horizontal propagation of internal gravity modes. The objective is to identify "baroclinic shoals" where wave energy is spatially concentrated and enhanced dissipation might be expected. The model is then extended to investigate the propagation of internal waves through a barotropic mesoscale current field. The refraction of tidally generated internal waves at the Hawaiian Ridge is examined using an ensemble of mesoscale background realizations derived from weekly Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon altimetric measurements. The path of mode 1 is only slightly affected by typical currents, although its phase becomes increasingly random as the propagation distance from the source increases. The effect of the currents becomes more dramatic as mode number increases. For modes 3 and higher, wave phase can vary between realizations by +/- \pi only a few wavelengths from the source. This phase variability reduces the magnitude of the baroclinic signal seen in altimetric data, creating a fictitious energy loss along the propagation path. In the TOPEX/Poseidon observations, the mode-1 M2 internal tide does appear to lose significant energy as it propagates southwestward from the Hawaiian Ridge. The simulations suggest that phase modulation by mesoscale flows could be responsible for a large fraction of this apparent loss. In contrast, northeast-propagating internal tides encounter a less energetic mesoscale and should experience limited refraction. The apparent energy loss seen in the altimetric data on the north side of the ridge might indeed be real.},

  abstract  = {A plume of low-salinity water was observed along the North Carolina coast 100 km south of the mouth of Chesapeake Bay during the Coastal Ocean Processes Pilot field program conducted from August through October 1994. The presence of the plume was episodic, occurring every 3 to 8 days. The timing was related to wind patterns, which influence both the delivery of estuarine discharge to the shelf and the plume's passage down the coast. When not affected by local winds, the low-salinity water was confined to within 7-9 km of the coast and was about 8 m deep. Downwelling winds narrow and deepen the plume, whereas upwelling winds cause it to thin and spread offshore, eventually detaching from the coast. The low-salinity plume propagated along the coast at speeds comparable to linear internal wave phase speed, except when strong downwelling wind conditions caused the plume to be in contact with the bottom. The observed propagation speeds are faster than those predicted by previous numerical modeling efforts. The plumes slowed with distance from the source, as mixing with ambient shelf water reduced the density contrast. This buoyancy source was balanced by an alongshore current with a southward velocity of 0.3 to 0.7 ms<SUP>-1</SUP>, bounded by a region of high horizontal velocity shear at the offshore salinity front. The currents observed in the nose of the plume are consistent with properties of an internal gravity current under rotation.},

  abstract  = {A high-frequency (1.2 MHz) acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) moored on the seabed has been used to observe the mean and turbulent flow components in a narrow tidally energetic channel over six tidal cycles at neap and spring tides. The Reynolds stress has been estimated from the difference in variance between the along-beam velocities of opposing acoustic beams with a correction for the sampling scheme and bin size. Shear stress was found to vary regularly with the predominantly semidiurnal tidal flow with the stresses on the spring ebb flow (up to 4.5 Pa) being generally greater than on the flood flow (,2 Pa) when the currents are weaker. The vertical structure approximated to linear stress profiles decreasing from maximum values near the bed to almost zero stresses just below the surface. The variation in the bed stress was well represented by a quadratic drag law, based on the depth-mean current, with an estimated drag coefficient of 2.6 6 0.2 3 1023. The production of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) followed a regular cycle at the M4 frequency with maximum values exceeding 1 W m23 near the bed during ebb flow at spring tides and decreasing with height to ;1023 W m23 at 2 m below the surface. Production was generally lowest (;1024 W m23) at low water slack, which was longer than high water slack, and is marked by a rapid transition from flood to ebb. During peak ebb and flood the vertical distribution of production and the eddy viscosity Nz are reasonably well described by a proposed model based on the law of the wall and a steady balance between the pressure gradient and a uniform shear stress gradient. The stress values have been incorporated into a trial dynamical balance based on the vertically integrated linearized equation of motion along the channel. The pressure gradient term is determined by two tide gauges separated by 5 km in the along-channel direction. The stress variation is in the correct phase to match the combined slope and acceleration term but is only about 60% of the magnitude required for balance. It is suggested that this discrepancy may result from an overestimation of the local pressure gradient, which may vary significantly between the tide gauges due to changes in the channel cross section.},

  abstract  = {Observations off the New Jersey coast document the shoaling of three groups of nonlinear internal waves of depression over 35 km across the shelf. Each wave group experienced changing background conditions along its shoreward transit. Despite different wave environments, a clear pattern emerges. Nearly symmetric waves propagating into shallow water develop an asymmetric shape; in the wave reference frame, the leading edge accelerates causing the front face to broaden while the trailing face remains steep. This trend continues until the front edge and face of the leading depression wave become unidentifiable and a near-bottom elevation wave emerges, formed from the trailing face of the initial depression wave and the leading face of the following wave. The transition from depression to elevation waves is diagnosed by the integrated wave vorticity, which changes sign as the wave’s polarity changes sign. This transition is predicted by the sign change of the coefficient of the nonlinear term in the KdV equation, when evaluated using observed profiles of stratification and velocity.},

  abstract      = {The authors present a field study of estuarine turbulence in which profiles of Reynolds stresses were directly measured using an ADCP throughout a 25-h tidal day. The dataset that is discussed quantifies turbulent mixing for a water column in northern San Francisco Bay that experiences a sequence of states that includes a weak ebb and flood that are stratified, followed by a strong, and eventually unstratified, ebb and flood. These measurements show that energetic turbulence is confined to a bottom mixed layer by the overlying stratification. Examination of individual Reynolds stress profiles along with profiles of Richardson number and turbulent Froude number shows that the water column can be divided into regions based on the relative importance of buoyancy effects. Using the measured turbulence production rate P, the dissipation rate e is estimated. The observed turbulence had values of e /nN2 . 20 all of the time and e /nN2 . 200 most of the time, suggesting that the observed motions were buoyancy affected turbulence rather than internal waves. However, at times, turbulent Froude numbers in much of the upper-water column were less than one, indicating important stratification effects. Taken as a whole, the data show that stratification affects the turbulent velocity variance q2 most severely; that is, observed reductions in u9w9 are largely associated with small values of q2 rather than with a dramatic reduction in the efficiency with which turbulent motions produce momentum fluxes. Finally, the dataset is compared to predictions made using the popular Mellor–Yamada level 2.5 closure. These comparisons show that the model tends to underestimate the turbulent kinetic energy in regions of strong stratification where the turbulence is strongly inhomogeneous and to overestimate the turbulent kinetic energy in weakly stratified regions. The length scale does not appear to compensate for these errors, and, as a result, similar errors are seen in the eddy viscosity predictions. It is hypothesized that the underestimation of q2 is due to an inaccurate parameterization of turbulence self-transport from the near-bed region to the overlying stratification.},

  abstract      = {In this paper we present a method for measuring profiles of turbulence quantities using a broadband acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP). The method follows previous work on the continental shelf and extends the analysis to develop estimates of the errors associated with the estimation methods. ADCP data was collected in an unstratified channel and the results of the analysis are compared to theory. This comparison shows that the method provides an estimate of the Reynolds stresses, which is unbiased by Doppler noise, and an estimate of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) which is biased by an amount proportional to the Doppler noise. The noise in each of these quantities as well as the bias in the TKE match well with the theoretical values produced by the error analysis. The quantification of profiles of Reynolds stresses simultaneous with the measurement of mean velocity profiles allows for extensive analysis of the turbulence of the flow. In this paper, we examine the relation between the turbulence and the mean flow through the calculation of u *, the friction velocity, and C d the coefficient of drag. Finally, we calculate quantities of particular interest in turbulence modeling and analysis, the characteristic lengthscales, including a lengthscale which represents the stream-wise scale of the eddies which dominate the Reynolds stresses.},

In a cylindrical tank on a rotating table, saline fluid is injected through an annular mesh encircling a cone of 1/15 slope. The resulting ring of fluid becomes unstable to periodic sinusoidal waves, whose characteristics are examined as a function of the ambient fluid depth, the rotation rate, and the salinity and depth of the dense current, the latter being related to the injection time. For experiments with relatively low-salinity currents, we find the phase speed of the instability is proportional to the rotation rate, Omega, rather than being proportional to the Nof speed, which varies as 1/Omega. Likewise, the number of waves observed is found to be inconsistent with existing theories for baroclinic instability of a dense current on a sloping bottom with a stationary ambient.},

The early stage of development of lock-release gravity current experiments is recorded in the laboratory frame of reference and subsequently transformed by software to a frame moving with the current head. Time averages of these statistically stationary flows are computed, with the technique providing not only the mean two-dimensional velocity field but also the vorticity, shear stress and divergence fields, and streamlines of the flows. The distributions of the magnitude of the fluid velocity fluctuation and Reynolds stress complete the picture of the flow.

  abstract  = {This paper presents a generalization of the classical results of T. B. Benjamin (J. Fluid. Mech. vol. 31, 1968, p. 209) concerning the propagation of a steady gravity current into a homogeneous ambient, to the case of a stratified ambient. The current of thickness h and density roh_c propagates, with speed U, at the bottom of a long horizontal channel of height H, into the unperturbed ambient whose density increases linearly from roh_o (at the top) to roh_b (at the bottom). The reduced gravity is g' = (roh_c/roh_o -1)g and the governing parameters are a = h/H and S = (roh_b-roh_o)/(roh_c-roh_o), with 0<a<1, 0 < S < 1 ; here g is the acceleration due to gravity. For a Boussinesq high-Reynolds two-dimensional configuration, a flow-field solution of Long's model, combined with flow-force balance over the width of the channel, are used for obtaining the desired results, in particular: Fr = U/(g'h)^{1/2}, head loss (dissipation), and criticality of U with respect to the fastest internal wave mode. The classical results of Benjamin are fully recovered for S rightarrow 0. For small S and fixed a, the values of Fr and head loss are shown to decrease with S like (1-2S/3)^{1/2} and (1-2S/3), respectively, and the propagation is supercritical. For larger S several solutions are possible (for a given geometry a), mostly in the subcritical regime. Considerations for the physical acceptability of the multiple results are presented, and the connection with observations from lock-release experiments are discussed. The conclusion is that the present results provide a reliable and versatile generalization of the classical unstratified problem.},

Attention is focused on effects due to stratification in the ambient. The investigation uses both a one-layer shallow-water model and Navier Stokes finite-difference simulations. There is good agreement between these two approaches for the energy of the dense fluid (the current). The results indicate that with respect to the behaviour of energy as a function of time we can distinguish between: (a) currents propagating at supercritical speed (with respect to the fastest internal wave in the ambient), including a nose propagating into an unstratified ambient; and (b) currents propagating at subcritical speed, including the strongest effective stratification for which the density at the base of the ambient is equal to that of the current. The stratification enhances the accumulation of potential energy in the ambient and reduces the energy decay (dissipation) of the two-fluid system. The interaction of the internal waves with the head of the current in the subcritical case has no significant influence on the energy balance of the current.},

Solutions for two-dimensional rectangular and axisymmetric geometries, with emphasis on the rotation of the latter, were obtained by a Lax Wendroff scheme. Box-model approximations are also discussed. The axisymmetric and rotating case admits steady-state lens structures, for which approximate and numerical solutions are presented. In general, the stratification reduces the velocity of propagation and enhances the Coriolis effects in a rotating system (in particular, the maximal radius of propagation decreases). Comparisons of the shallow-water results with Navier Stokes simulations and laboratory experiments indicate good agreement, at least for the initial period of propagation. The major deficiency of this shallow-water model is the lack of incorporation of internal waves. In particular, if the propagation is at subcritical speed, the applicability of the model is restricted to the time prior to the first effective interaction between the head of the gravity current and the lowest-order internal wave; an estimate of this position is presented.},

Attention is focused on the initial `slumping' stage of a rectangular current which is typified by a constant speed of propagation. The analytical results are in good agreement with, and give a firm theoretical interpretation of, the corresponding experiments and numerical simulations of Maxworthy et al. (2002). Finite-difference solutions of the Navier Stokes equations, using a different technique from that used by Maxworthy et al. (2002), are also presented and provide both good agreement with their results and further validation of the present shallow-water approach.

  abstract  = {Axisymmetric gravity currents in a system rotating around a vertical axis, that result when a dense fluid intrudes horizontally under a less dense ambient fluid, are studied. Situations for which the density difference between the fluid is due either to compositional differences or to suspended particulate matter are considered. The fluid motion is described theoretically by the inviscid shallow-water equations. A `diffusion' equation for the volume fraction in the suspension is derived for the particle-driven case, and two different models for this purpose are presented. We focus attention on situations in which the apparent importance of the Coriolis terms relative to the inertial terms, represented by the parameter [script C] (the inverse of a Rossby number), is not large. Numerical and asymptotic solutions of the governing equations clarify the essential features of the flow field and particle distribution, and point out the striking differences from the non-rotating case (Bonnecaze, Huppert & Lister 1995). It is shown that the Coriolis effects eventually become dominant; even for small [script C], Coriolis effects are negligible only during an initial period of about one tenth of a revolution. Thereafter the interface of the current acquires a shape which has a downward decreasing profile at the nose and its velocity of propagation begins to decrease to zero more rapidly than in the non-rotating situation. This relates the currents investigated here to the previously studied quasi-steady oceanographic structures called rings, eddies, vortices or lenses, and may throw additional light on the dynamics of their formation. The theoretical results were tested by some preliminary experiments performed in a rotating cylinder of diameter 90 cm filled with a layer of water of depth 10 cm in which a cylinder of heavier saline fluid of diameter 9.4 cm was released.},

  abstract  = {The behaviour of an inviscid gravity current of finite volume which is released from behind a lock and then propagates over a horizontal boundary is considered, for the elucidation of the initial `slumping' phase during which the nose propagates with a constant velocity. The shallow-water two-layer model is used and the necessary front condition is provided, for comparisons, by four different correlations for the nose Froude function. Analytical and numerical results are presented, which reveal the essential flow-field features for various values of the governing dimensionless parameter H, the initial depth ratio of the outer embedding fluid to that of the dense fluid in the lock. It is shown that in the two-dimensional configuration a clear-cut slumping stage develops for any value of H, but for H<2 this stage is complicated by jumps of the interface (backward and forward moving bores) and constrained maximal nose velocity. The two-layer model provides good qualitative and quantitative agreements with previously published measurements, but the one-layer model mispredicts the dependency of the slumping distance on H. In the axisymmetric configuration a clear-cut slumping stage develops only for values of H close to 1 (shallow ambient), and persists for a relatively short time and distance. The effect of the Froude correlations and implementation to box-model approximations are also discussed.},

  abstract  = {A numerical model has been developed for simulating density-stratified flow in domains with irregular but simple topography. The model was designed for simulating strong interactions between internal gravity waves and topography, e.g. exchange flows in contracting channels, tidally or convectively driven flow over two-dimensional sills or waves propagating onto a shoaling bed. The model is based on the non-hydrostatic, Boussinesq equations of motion for a continuously stratified fluid in a rotating frame, subject to user-configurable boundary conditions. An orthogonal boundary fitting co-ordinate system is used for the numerical computations, which rely on a fourth-order compact differentiation scheme, a third-order explicit time stepping and a multi-grid based pressure projection algorithm. The numerical techniques are described and a suite of validation studies are presented. The validation studies include a pointwise comparison of numerical simulations with both analytical solutions and laboratory measurements of non-linear solitary wave propagation. Simulation results for flows lacking analytical or laboratory data are analysed a posteriori to demonstrate satisfaction of the potential energy balance. Computational results are compared with two-layer hydraulic predictions in the case of exchange flow through a contracting channel. Finally, a simulation of circulation driven by spatially non-uniform surface buoyancy flux in an irregular basin is discussed. Copyright},

This model is used to examine the kinematic and dynamic factors that control the depth and propagation speed of the density current and the geometric shape of the density current front. For an idealized inviscid flow, the results show that the density current becomes deeper and propagates faster relative to the environmental flow as the shear increases toward positive (i.e., the system-relative inflow speed decreases with height). When the effects of energy loss and negative vorticity generation are taken into account for the entire or physically constrained fractional depth of the upper-layer outflow, multiple solutions are found for two possible flow states: supercritical and subcritical. similar to that of Benjamin. The supercritical (or subcritical) state is characterized by a large (small) Froude number for the downstream upper-layer outflow, in which case the density current is shallower (or much shallower) and propagates slightly faster (or significantly slower) than the idealized inviscid one. The depth and propagation speed of a density current of supercritical (or subcritical) state increase rapidly (or decrease very slowly) as the shear increases toward positive, but change very slightly (or significantly) with the energy loss and/or negative vorticity generation. Applications of the model results to real atmospheric density currents are also discussed.},

This fully nonlinear analytical model is used to examine the kinematic and dynamic factors that control the depth and propagation speed of the density current and the geometric shape of the density current front. The results show that in comparison with the environmental inflow shear, the strength of the internal circulation within the cold pool of a density current plays a secondary role in controlling the depth and propagation speed of the density current, at least one having constant vorticity. The direction of the cold pot circulation can be either clockwise or anticlockwise, not affecting the propagation speed, depth, and geometric shape of an inviscid conservative density current. Physical interpretation of the results is provided in regard to the way that the inflow shear controls the shape of the density current head and produces the `'optimal state'' for supporting long-lived squall lines.},

  abstract  = {The previous idealized two-fluid model of a density current in constant shear is extended to the case where the inflow shear is confined to the low levels. The analytical solution is determined by the conservation of mass, momentum, vorticity, and energy. It is found that a low-level shear acts in a similar manner to a uniform vertical shear in controlling the depth of a steady-state density current. When the shear enhances the low-level flow against the density current propagation, the current is deeper than half of the domain depth. Time-dependent numerical experiments are conducted for a variety of parameter settings, including various depths and strengths of the shear layer. The numerical results agree closely with the theoretical analyses.Numerical experiments are also performed for a case where the initial depth of the density current is set to be comparable to the low-level shear, which is much shallower than that given by the steady-state solution. The circulation at the density current head remains shallow and is nonsteady in this case, whereas the time-averaged flow still exhibits a deep jump updraft pattern that is close to the theoretical solution, suggesting the applicability of the theoretical results to even more transient flows.The simulated flow features are discussed in terms of balanced and unbalanced dynamics, and in the context of forcing and uplifting at the frontal zone in long-lived convective systems. Here the term balance refers to a flow configuration that satisfies the steady-state solution of the idealized theoretical model.},
