\abstract{
Acoustic Doppler velocimeters (ADVs) are a valuable tool for making high-precision measurements of turbulence and moorings are a convenient and ubiquitous platform for making many kinds of measurements in the ocean. However---because of concerns that mooring motion can contaminate turbulence measurements and acoustic Doppler profilers are relatively easy to deploy---ADVs are not frequently deployed from moorings.  This work details a method for measuring turbulence using moored ADVs that corrects for mooring motion using measurements from inertial motion sensors. Three distinct mooring platforms were deployed in a tidal channel with inertial-motion-sensor-equipped ADVs. In each case, the inertial measurements dramatically reduced contamination from mooring motion. The spectra from these measurements have a shape that is consistent with other measurements in tidal channels, and have a $f^{-5/3}$ slope at high frequencies---consistent with Kolmogorov's theory of isotropic turbulence. Motion correction also improves estimates of cross-spectra and Reynold's stresses. Comparison of turbulence dissipation with flow speed and turbulence production indicates a bottom boundary layer production-dissipation balance during ebb and flood that is consistent with the strong tidal forcing at the site. These results indicate that inertial-motion-sensor-equipped ADVs are a valuable new tool for measuring turbulence from moorings.
