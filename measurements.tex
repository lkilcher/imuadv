This work is focused on measuring turbulence from ADVs that are deployed from non-stationary platforms and equipped with inertial motion sensors (IMU). The ADVs utilized for these measurements were all equipped with Microstrain 3DM-GX3-25 IMU sensors that captured all 6 components of the ADV motion (3 components of angular rotation and 3 components of linear acceleration), as well as the orientation of the ADV pressure-case. The sampling of the motion sensor is tightly synchronized with the ADV measurements. The IMU measures its motion at 1kHz and uses internal signal integration (Kalman filtering) to output the motion signals at the same sample rate as the ADV's velocity measurements. This reduces aliasing of the IMU's motion measurements above the ADV's sample-rate \cite[]{3DM-GX3_coning_sculling}. Cable-head ADVs were utilized throughout this work to allow for flexibility in the positioning of the ADV head relative to its pressure case.

All measurements used in this work were made in Admiralty Inlet, Washington, approximately 500 meters (m) WSW of Admiralty Head--Fort Casey State Park--in 60 m of water depth at latitude 48.153 north and longitude 122.687 west (Figure \ref{fig:map}). The site is approximately 6 kilometers (km) east of Port Townsend, and 1 km north of the Port Townsend -- Coupeville ferry route.  Admiralty inlet is the largest waterway connecting Puget Sound to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and it possesses a large semi-diurnal tidal flow.  This work utilizes data from three distinct deployment platforms: the `tidal turbulence mooring', a `StableMoor' buoy, and a simple sounding weight.  Additional details, photos, and schematic diagrams of all three mooring systems can be found in Part 1.

\subsection{Tidal Turbulence Mooring (TTM)}

The `tidal turbulence mooring' (TTM) is a simple mooring system with a `strongback fin' suspended between a steel clump-weight anchor weighing 1200 kilograms (kg) when dry and a 0.93 m-diameter spherical steel buoy with a buoyancy of 320 kg. The ADV pressure cases were clamped to one side of the strongback fin and the ADV sensor head was positioned 10 cm in front of the fin's leading edge (Figure \ref{fig:ttm:diagram}). The leading edge of the fin is fastened inline with the mooring line. This configuration  was designed to work similar to a weather-vane, such that the drag on the fin held the ADV head upstream of the mooring components.  This work utilizes data from two TTM deployments. 

\subsubsection{June 2012 TTM deployment}

The first was in June of 2012 at 48.15285 north, 122.68581 west. The mooring was in the water from 17:30 on the 12th until 14:30 on the 14th (local, i.e. pacific daylight time). Two Nortek ADVs were clamped to either side of the fin such that the axis of their cylindrical pressure-cases were parallel with the leading edge of the strongback. The ADV heads were spaced 0.5 m apart vertically along the fin. Only one of these ADVs was equipped with an integrated IMU. This TTM also had an upward-looking acoustic Doppler profiler mounted on the mooring anchor.

Periods of time during which this mooring interfered with a beam of the Doppler profiler were identified by inspection of the profiler's acoustic amplitude signal. Periods during which one beam of the profiler had $>5\%$ higher acoustic amplitude than the other beams were flagged as `contaminated' and excluded from averaging.  5-minute averages in which more than 50\% of the data was contaminated in this way were masked as invalid.

\subsubsection{June 2014 TTM deployment}

The second TTM deployment was in 2014 from 06:00 on June 17 to 05:00 on June 19 (local time). The mooring was positioned at 48.15327 north, 122.68654 west.  Two Nortek ADV-IMUs were mounted on this TTM, with their heads spaced 0.5 m apart along the fin. In this case the pressure-cases and ADV heads were inclined at an angle of 18$^\circ$ to the leading edge of the fin to account for mooring blow-down during strong currents (Figure \ref{fig:ttm:photo}). This change was made to reduce vibrational motion observed during the June 2012 deployment that was believed to be associated with the orientation of the pressure cases.

\subsection{The StableMoor platform}

The second deployment platform was a cylindrical, `StableMoor', syntactic foam buoy (manufacturer: Deep Water Buoyancy) that was anchored to a clump weight that weighed 2700 lbs (Figure \ref{fig:SM}). The buoy is 3.5 m long and 0.45 m in diameter with a tail ring that is 0.76 m in diameter. The StableMoor weighs 295 kg in air, and has a buoyancy of 185 kg in water. 

The StableMoor was ballasted to pitch upward a few degrees in zero-flow to avoid `flying downward'. In the presence of an oncoming current the tail fins help to orient it into the flow. The anchor for this buoy is similar to that of the TTM, including an acoustic release so the mooring and anchor can be recovered separately.

The StableMoor platform has two primary advantages compared to the TTM. First, it is significantly more massive and hydro-dynamically stable than the TTM, which reduces the frequency of motions of the platform. The other major advantage of the StableMoor platform is that it is capable of supporting a bottom-tracking acoustic Doppler profiler, which provides an independent measure of the platform's translational motion. Disadvantages of the StableMoor include: a) its size adds to the challenge of deployment and recovery, and b) it is significantly more expensive than the TTM system.

This work uses data from two deployments of the StableMoor.

The StableMoor was deployed with an ADV-IMU mounted at its nose from 11:21 on May 12 to 11:53 on May 13, 2015 (local time). This deployment was at 48.15277 north, 122.68623 west. In this configuration the sample volume of the ADV is 10 cm forward of the nose and 20 cm above the centerline of the StableMoor (Figure \ref{fig:SM}). Based on \citeauthor{Wyngaard++1985}'s (1985) investigation of a similarly shaped slender body the velocity measurements should have flow-distortion effects of less than 10\%. This configuration was designed to be the most stable platform for measuring turbulence from a moving platform. The StableMoor was equipped with a 1200 kHz RDI workhorse sentinel acoustic Doppler profiler that was oriented downward-looking to measure water velocity below the platform in 12 1-meter bins and measure buoy motion (`bottom tracking'), all at a 1 Hz sample rate. 

\subsection{Turbulence Torpedo}

The turbulence torpedo is a simple sounding weight with an ADV head mounted forward of the nose, and the ADV pressure case strapped below. This platform was deployed on May 14, 2015 for 37 minutes starting at 07:41 local time.  This measurement was made from a davit that hung the system from the side of the ship to a depth of approximately 25 m. The primary logistical advantages of this platform are its compact size, low cost, and the flexibility to perform spatial transects.

\subsection{Coordinate system and turbulence averaging}

Unless stated otherwise, vector quantities in this work are in a fixed `principal-axes' coordinate system that is aligned with the bi-directional tidal flow: positive $u$ is in the direction of ebb (310$^\circ$ True), positive $w$ is vertically upward, and $v$ is the cross-stream component in a right-handed coordinate system. The full velocity vector, $\vec{\tilde{u}} = (\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}, \tilde{w})$, is separated into a mean and turbulent component as $\vec{\tilde{u}} = \vec{\bar{u}} + \vec{u}$, where the over-bar denotes a 5 minute average. Turbulence kinetic energy, $\tke = \uu + \vv+\ww$, and Reynold's stresses, $\uv$, $\uw$, $\vw$ are computed by averaging over the 5-minute window.  Throughout this work we use $\bar{U} = (\bar{u}^2+\bar{v}^2)^{1/2}$ to denote the mean horizontal velocity magnitude. 

All spectra, $\spec{x}(f)=|\fourier{x(t)}|^2$, and cross-spectra, $\cspec{x}{y}(f)=\mathrm{real}(\fourier{x(t)}\fourier{y(t)})$, are computed using NumPy fast Fourier transform routines \cite[]{Walt++2011}. Here, $\fourier{x(t)}$ denotes the fast Fourier transform of a signal $x(t)$. Time series', e.g. $x(t)$, are linearly detrended and Hanning windowed prior to computing $\fourier{x}$ to reduce spectral reddening.  

Throughout the remainder of this work the dependence of $S$ and $C$ on $f$ is implied (e.g. $\spec{x}(f)$ is hereafter $\spec{x}$), and for other variables the dependence on $t$ is implied. Spectra and cross-spectra are normalized to preserve variance: $\int \spec{u}\mathrm{d}f = \uu$, and  $\int \cspec{u}{v}\mathrm{d}f = \uv$. The notations $\spec{\ue}=(\spec{u}, \spec{v}, \spec{w})$ and $C\{\ue\} = (\cspec{u}{v}, \cspec{u}{w}, \cspec{v}{w} )$ denote the set of spectra and cross-spectra for each velocity component and pairs of components, respectively.

Turbulence dissipation rates are computed as,
\begin{align}
  \epsilon = \frac{1}{\bar{U}}\left(\alpha\left\langle(\spec{u}+\spec{v}+\spec{w})f^{5/3}\right\rangle_{f_{IS}}\right)^{3/2}
\end{align}
Where  $\alpha=0.5$, and $\langle\rangle_{f_{IS}}$ denotes an average over the inertial-subrange of the velocity spectra and where the signal-to-noise ratio is small \cite[]{Lumley+Terray1983,Sreenivasan1995}. Throughout this work we take this average from 0.3 to 1 Hz for the $u$ and $v$ components, and 0.3 to 3 Hz for the $w$ component.
