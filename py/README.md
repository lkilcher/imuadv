The analysis in these scripts were done using:

- Python 2.7.13
- dolfyn 0.8.0
- MatPlotLib 1.5.1
- NumPy 1.12.1
- scipy 0.19.0
- h5py 2.7.0, 
- [mpl_basemap](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/) 1.0.7, for the map (Figure 1).

Once you have python installed, you can get most of these packages by doing:

    $ pip install -r py/requirements.txt

If you want to be able to reproduce Figure 1 (map), [follow the instruction for installing basemap](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html).

Once those steps are complete, the source data can be downloaded and processed by:

    $ python setup_data.py
    
This will download data source from the [MHK Data Repository](mhkdr.openei.org). It will take significant time, and disk space. Once that step is complete, all of the figures in the final publication can be re-generated by doing:

    $ python make_figs.py
    
Note that this script executes several other scripts. These scripts include many other analyses intermediate analyses/figures that were not documented in the report. The scripts make heavy use of flags (in the form of a `flag` variable) to determine which pieces of the analysis are done. Thus, if you want to look at that additional analyses, simply set the relavent flag to `True`.
